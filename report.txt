Brief file description:
-launch folder:
	-gmap.launch: creates a map with slam_gmapping reading from the /scan topic. Includes a static transformation from the robot's base frame (base_link) to the laser's frame (laser).
	              The file also open an rviz configuration to see the process.
	-amcl.launch: runs amcl node with proper settings, the map is taken from /map topic and the laser data from /laser topic.
	-localization.launch: first launches the map server exposing the correct map, then runs the ekf_localization_node from ROS robot_localization package.
	                      The implemented EKF algorithm uses the odometry for the prediction step and then the imu data, filtered by a complementary_filter_node (also run by this launch file) for the correction step.

-maps folder:
	-map.pgm: the map resulted from gmapping with 1.bag
	-map.yaml: description parameters correleted to map.pgm
	TODO, or fixing the maps or insert all the other maps

-rviz folder:
	-localization.rviz: file with a custom configuration to visualize the robot with rviz during localization. It shows pose, Odometry, covariance, laser and the particles of the amcl.
	-configuration.rviz: file with a custom configuration to visualize the robot with rviz during the creation of the map using gmapping. It shows TODO!.

-deliverables folder:
    -TODO

-CMakeLists.txt: default cmake file because there is no need for building custom nodes.

-package.xml: also standard configuration.

TF tree structure:
- static transformations between world--->map and wolrd--->Robot1/base_link are set just for visualization purposes on rviz.
- A static TF from base_link to laser which sets a rotation of 97Â° on the Z axes
- the TF between odom and base_link is computed by the localization filter node
- the TF between map and odom is computed by amcl node

How to use launch files:
-first launch gmap.launch and consequently the first bag (1.bag). Once the bag has finished, run map server to save the map (map.pgm and map.yaml).
-launch approximately all together localization.launch, amcl.launch and the bag on which the robot has to be localized.
-Rviz will open showing the custom configuration mentioned before.
-the tf between odom (robot's reference frame) and base_link (robot's pose) is computed by the localization node.
-the tf between map (global reference frame) and odom is computed by the amcl node that corrects the drift.

Sensors choice:
- from the /odom topic we've selected the x and y coordinates, the velocity only on the X axis because it's a differential drive kinematics (Y velocity=0) and also the angular velocity (yaw')
- from the imu we've selected those data that the odometry did not compute directly
